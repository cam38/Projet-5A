## Camille Euvrard - 5th year engineering school project

# Projet-5A
Implementation of a GUI for the embedded system SimpleEmbOS

# Why an graphical interface ?
SimpleEmbOS is an embedded system for wireless sensor networks. It is a system designed to facilitate the development of multiprocessor and fault-tolerant applications. It has been developed by the SMIR team of the Laboratory of Computer Science, Modelling and Optimisation of Systems (LIMOS). The main users of this embedded system are agronomist engineers and it is mainly used to collect information in agricultural areas. 
Users of SimpleEmbOS find it difficult to configure the system to take appropriate measurements with the sensors. This is because the system is programmed in C, and configuring the sensors to take the correct measurements requires advanced programming skills, which is not necessarily the case for all users.
The aim of my 5th year project is to enable all SimpleEmbOS users to take measurements in a simple and intuitive way via the embedded system. In other words without spending time developing programs. The idea is to develop a graphical interface, so that engineers can take measurements without having to program.

# Report
You can find the report of my project (in French) in the folder "Projet 5A".

# Warning
This code is not finished, as it is a long term project and I have had a few months to develop it. You will find in my report all the stages of the implementation of this project.
